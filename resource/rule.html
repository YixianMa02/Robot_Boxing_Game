        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            This is a simple web game application coded with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GoLang. 
            This is a turn based boxing game where the player will be chanllenged by the AI.
            Remember, this is still a prototype version under developement. 
        </p>

        <h3>Game Rules</h3>
        <p>
            You will be assigning randomly a character which you will used to play this game.
            Both of the character will have five health bar in total. The game end when one of the character lose all his health bar. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            In the first phase, you will do rock, paper and scissor with the AI. The winner can perform an attack which will cause the defender lose one bar of his health.
            Then we proceed to the second phase. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the second phase, you will have the choose between "Light Attack", "Heavy Attack", and "Defense". The "Light Attack" is a fast attack which takes one health bar from the defender (deals one damage).
            The "Heavy Attack" is a slow attack which takes two health bar from the defender (deals two damage). The "Defense" can protact the user up to one damage only. 
            In brief, "Light Attack" counters "Heavy Attack", "Heavy Attack" counters "Defense", and "Defense" counters "Light Attack".
